1. git init : This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. 
              This is the first step in creating a local repository. 
              After running git init, adding and commiting files/directories is possible.
              It creates the initial .git directory in a new or in an existing project.

2. git add : Before a file is available to commit to a repository, the file needs to be added to the Git index(staging area).
             There are a few different ways to use git add, by adding entire directories, specific files, or all unstaged files.
             To add files that are not staged : git add .
             To stage a specific file : git add demo.txt
             To stage an entire directory : git add <directory_name>

3. git commit : Record the changes made to the files to a local repository.
                Each commit has a unique id.
                Example : git commit -m "my first commit". Adding a commit message helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes.             

4. git status : This command returns the current status of the repository.
                git status will return the current working branch.
                If a file is in the staging area, but not committed, it shows with git status.
                If there are no changes it will return "nothing to commit, working directory clean"

5. git log : Shows a listing of commit on a branch including the corresponding details.
